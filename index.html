<p> <b>Charles Augustus Lindbergh</b> was born on Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit as the son of Charles August Lindbergh, and Evangeline Lodge Land. He grew up on a farm near Little Falls, Minnesota. However, he spent most of his childhood in Washington, D.C., where his father Charles August Lindbergh was a U.S. Congressman. As a child, Lindbergh showed exceptional mechanical ability. He was interested in the young field of aviation. At the age of 18, he entered the University of Wisconsin to study engineering but soon left to become a barnstormer. At the age of 22, Lindbergh enlisted in the U.S. Army so that he could be trained as an Army Air Service Reserve Pilot, and 3 years later, he graduated from the Army's flight training school as the best pilot in his class. Soon after, he was hired by the <i>Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis</i> to fly mail between St. Louis and Chicago.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, hotel owner Raymond Orteig offered a prize of <b>$25,000</b> to the first pilot to make the journey from <i>New York</i> to <i>Paris</i> without making any stops. By 1927, Lindbergh decided to take part in the challenge with the support of some businessmen in St. Louis to help finance the cost of the plane, which he named <b><i>"The Spirit of St. Louis"</i></b>. On May 20, Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field at 7:52 A.M. and landed at Le Bourget Field on May 21 at 10:21 P.M. Paris time (5:21 P.M. New York). He had flown more than 3,600 miles in 33 1/2 hours. Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by more than 100,00 people who came to see aviation history in the making.<br><br>Being the first person to fly nonstop across the Atlantic, Lindbergh became an instant worldwide celebrity. He was given a ticker tape parade in New York with an estimated 4 million people who came to see him. Lindbergh also won several awards and medals of honor from the U.S., France, and other countries. President Calvin Coolidge presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross and made him a colonel in the Air Corps Coolidge.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping</h3>

<p>During A trip to Mexico, Lindbergh met Anne Morrow, the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Mexico at the time. They wed in 1929, in which he then taught her to fly, and they went on many trips together around the world. They soon had a kid named Charles Augustus, Jr. On March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs’ 20-month-old boy was kidnapped from their home. The Lindberghs found a ransom note in the nursery room of the toddler demanding <b>$50,00</b>. A few days later a new ransom note turned up demanding <b>$70,000</b>. Once they delivered the money, they were told that their baby could be found on a boat named <i>"Nellie"</i> off the coast. However, there was no sign of the toddler or the boat. A few months later, a truck driver found the baby’s body about four miles from the Lindbergh home. The baby was partially buried and badly decomposed and had been dead for about two months. The police traced the money to carpenter Bruno Hauptmann, and they arrested him for his crime.</p>

He had four more children with Anne, and lived quietly in Connecticut and then Hawaii. He wrote several books about his life, including “The Spirit of St. Louis” and “The Culture of Organs”. He finally died of cancer on August 26, 1974, and was buried on the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
