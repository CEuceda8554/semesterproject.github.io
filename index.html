<p> <b>Charles Augustus Lindbergh</b> was born on Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit as the son of Charles August Lindbergh, and Evangeline Lodge Land. He grew up on a farm near Little Falls, Minnesota. However, he spent most of his childhood in Washington, D.C., where his father Charles August Lindbergh was a U.S. Congressman. As a child, Lindbergh showed exceptional mechanical ability. He was interested in the young field of aviation. At the age of 18, he entered the University of Wisconsin to study engineering, but soon left to become a barnstormer. At the age of 22, Lindbergh enlisted in the U.S. Army so that he could be trained as an Army Air Service Reserve Pilot, and 3 years later, he graduated from the Army's flight-training school as the best pilot in his class. Soon after, he was hired by the <i>Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis</i> to fly mail between St. Louis and Chicago.</p>

<h3>Flight To Paris</h3>
<p>In 1920's hotel owner Raymond Orteig offered a prize of <b>$25,000</b> to the first pilot to make the journey from <i>New York</i> to <i>Paris</i> without making any stops. By 1927, Lindbergh decided to take part in the challenge with the support of some businessmen in St. Louis to help finance the cost of the plane, which he named <b><i>"The Spirit of St. Louis"</i></b>. On May 20, Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field at 7:52 A.M., and landed at Le Bourget Field on May 21 at 10:21 P.M. Paris time (5:21 P.M. New York). He had flown more than 3,600 miles in 33 1/2 hours. Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by more than 100,00 people who came to see aviation history in the making.</p>
