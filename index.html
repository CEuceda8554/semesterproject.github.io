<h1>Charles Lindbergh</h1>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Charles Augustus Lindbergh was born on Feb. 4, 1902, in Detroit as the son of Charles August Lindbergh, and Evangeline Lodge Land. He grew up on a farm near Little Falls, Minnesota. However, he spent most of his childhood in Washington, D.C., where his father Charles August Lindbergh was a U.S. Congressman. As a child, Lindbergh showed exceptional mechanical ability. He was interested in the young field of aviation. At the age of 18, he entered the University of Wisconsin to study engineering, but soon left to become a barnstormer. At the age of 22, Lindbergh enlisted in the U.S. Army so that he could be trained as an Army Air Service Reserve Pilot, and 3 years later, he graduated from the Army's flight-training school as the best pilot in his class. Soon after, he was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis to fly mail between St. Louis and Chicago.</p>
